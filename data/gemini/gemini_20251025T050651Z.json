    "Roast for about 15 minutes, until the skin is deeply charred and the eggplant starts to deflate.",
    "Place the eggplants in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap.",
    "Allow them to steam and cool for 15 minutes, so that excess liquid can be removed.",
    "Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh onto a cutting board.",
    "Roughly chop the eggplants to break apart the stringy bits.",
    "Add the chopped eggplants to a large mixing bowl and use a fork to mash it up.",
    "Once it becomes a nice chunky consistency, add in the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, and parsley.",
    "Give everything a good stir until it's well combined.",
    "Transfer the final baba ganoush into a small bowl and garnish with extra chopped parsley and a drizzle of olive oil."
