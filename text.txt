Chicken piccata is an Italian-American favorite and one of the easiest weeknight dinner recipes to make at home. Juicy chicken breasts are dredged in flour, seared with a golden crust, then simmered in a lemon butter sauce with a touch of capers and parsley. It‚Äôs a beautiful and tasty dinner that comes together quickly!
What is Chicken Piccata?
Without a doubt ‚Äî chicken piccata is the perfect fusion of Italian cooking in America. Traditionally, piccata is an Italian dish consisting of thinly breaded veal (or other proteins) with a lemon butter wine sauce. But today we‚Äôre using chicken, and I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve perfected this dish that‚Äôs dotted with garlic, capers, and fresh parsley. The more herbs and garlic, the better, right?
And while we‚Äôre big fans of this Tuscan chicken or chicken Marsala, this chicken piccata recipe is another Italian-inspired favorite. It‚Äôs juicy, lemony, and just what you need to give chicken breasts a fresh new lift at dinner.
Chicken Piccata Recipe Ingredients
- Chicken: You‚Äôll need a couple of large, boneless, skinless chicken breasts.
- Dredging Mixture: To achieve that golden crust, coat the chicken in a mixture of flour, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. I‚Äôm using arrowroot flour as a gluten-free option. But you could use almost any flour in this recipe, so choose your favorite.
- Chicken Piccata Sauce: This is the heart and soul of the recipe! The sauce consists of fresh lemon juice, a dry white wine, chicken broth, butter, garlic, capers, and fresh parsley. If you don‚Äôt want to use white wine, you could also substitute it with more chicken broth.

How To Make Chicken Piccata
Slice the chicken. We‚Äôre going for a ‚Äúscaloppine‚Äù type of dish here, which essentially means thinly sliced meat. So, you‚Äôll need to slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally, as if you were going to butterfly them. Thinner chicken also cooks faster ‚Äì something we all love on busy weeknights!
Coat the chicken. Mix the flour, parmesan, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl or dish (using a plate can get a bit messy!). Then dredge the chicken in the mixture, coating both sides.
Cook the chicken. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes per side, until perfectly golden. Then use tongs to remove the chicken pieces to a separate plate.
Make the sauce. Add the wine and garlic to the pan, letting it simmer for 3 to 4 minutes until reduced by about half. Then add the broth, lemon juice, capers, and butter. Keep stirring the sauce until it begins to simmer again.
Add the chicken. Add the chicken back to the pan. Spoon the sauce on top until each piece is coated well. Then let it simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until warmed through. And for the finishing touch, sprinkle some fresh parsley on top!
Storage Tips
Don‚Äôt be alarmed if there are no leftovers over. Yes, it‚Äôs that kind of recipe. But if you need to store any away, here‚Äôs how:
- To store: Store in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Make sure to save all the extra sauce left in the pan as well!
- To freeze: You might want to plan ahead and make a second batch to store in the freezer! It will keep for up to 3 months in a freezer-safe container.

Brilliant! My new favourite go-to chicken dish. Being Australian, I‚Äôve heard of Chicken Piccata on many American TV shows. The Aussie Italians that migrated in the 1950s and 1960s didn‚Äôt bring this recipe to our neck of the woods so I‚Äôve always been curious as to what it tasted like! I‚Äôll be making this again, for sure, thanks Lisa! :)
Glad you were able to finally get a taste of a dish you had always heard about, Sarah!

I never loved white meat of chicken because it seemed so bland. That is until I tried this piccata recipe that then led me to marsala and now I‚Äôm hooked on both and look forward to checking out ALL of your recipes in which chicken breasts are the star and are fairly easy and fast to prepare.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs all about making the right sauce with it. Glad you‚Äôre loving those chicken recipes, Nancy!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY üéÇ
Thank you so much for sharing your recipes with us! Love the cookbook! I made the chicken picata, it was excellent! Even my Sicilian boyfriend enjoyed it!üíñ
Thanks, Nina! Happy to hear both you and your husband are loving this dish.
I love chicken picatta and this recipe taught me how to make it at home. I serve it over angel hair pasta and add a simple veggie.
Homemade chicken piccata is the best! Glad you learned how to make it now, Roby.
I have made this recipe twice over the past week or so, and we all love it! My son in particular drools over it! I can‚Äôt get over how easy and delicious it is. Also, I am a huge fan of capers, so I particularly love this one. Thank you!
Wonderful! Glad everyone has been loving this chicken piccata dish, Michelle.
I absolutely loved this recipe. It was easy to make and the sauce and chicken was so good. The capers really made it. I‚Äôve never made anything with capers. To me this recipe is classy and very tasty. Thumbs UP!
Thanks so much for your positive review, Becky! I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the capers and this chicken piccata recipe.

Thanks so much, Nina! Glad you both are loving this chicken picatta dish!
So good. Don‚Äôt change a thing. The thinner the chicken, the better, in my opinion, and you can never have too many capers. My family devoured this and has asked for more.
I agree, the more capers the better. Happy to hear you and your family loved the recipe, Kathy!
This was absolutely fabulous and very easy to make!
My husband loved it also!
Happy to hear both you and your husband enjoyed this chicken piccata, Lauren!
Can this be made a little in advance. I would like to serve to guests for a first time meeting them and don‚Äôt want to be cooking with my back to them as they first arrive. It sounds like a great choice
Hi Rebecca ‚Äì I personally feel this recipe is best eaten right away, but it‚Äôs really up to you. The ‚Äúcrust‚Äù on the chicken will just go softer the longer it sits. But if you‚Äôre okay with that, then go ahead and make it a little in advance. I‚Äôm right there with you in not wanting my back to guests when they arrive. :)
This is one of our favorite meals. The lemon and capers are just delicious. It‚Äôs an easy meal that‚Äôs great for company, too. Just delicious.
This chicken picatta really is the best of all worlds! Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it, Mary.
Totally Love This Recipe! Simple and sooooo satisfying. Next will be protein pancakes!
Hi Kristine ‚Äì Happy to hear you‚Äôre loving this chicken piccata recipe!
I have always used Giada‚Äôs chicken piccata recipe, but decided to try this one for a change. and Woo hoo, this one so so so much better than Giada‚Äôs. Maybe its the garlic, but hands down‚Ä¶ much much better for sure.
Hi Beth ‚Äì Happy to hear you found a new favorite chicken piccata recipe!
I made this reciipe tonight for the first time. Delicious! I did substitue almod flour for the arrowroot, rather than buy it specially for this recipe. It worked well and the taste was good, but I wonder if arrowroot would have thickened the sauce a little more. I also used chjeicken tenders rather than try to slice large chicken breasts. A little higher cost, but worth it in time saving and mess.
Thank you so much for sharing your tasty and healthful recipes with us. Even my picky eaters love them ‚Äì and I love that I am getting them to eat healthy at least some of the time!
Hi Sue ‚Äì yes, arrowroot flour is more of a thickener than almond flour. But happy you and your picky eaters loved the recipe!
We enjoyed it but found it a bit salty. Because the capers are salty, I wouldn‚Äôt add the salt next time.
You can always tweak the recipe to your liking, Lenore. Enjoy!
I made this for the first time tonight. It is delicious! I am so happy with the flavors and the way the sauce came together! Thank you Lisa for such wonderful recipes!!
Wonderful! I‚Äôm so glad your chicken piccata turned out perfectly, Letitia.
Hi Lisa! This one is another favorite of my family. It was pretty easy to make. It‚Äôs a lot more fun when I make the chicken portion and my husband handles the sauce portion. I just love it when we cook together. The chicken comes out very moist and we love the flavors of the capers, butter, and lemon. We add a little more broth instead of the cooking wine. We love to layer it on top of egg noodles, or steamed veggies.
What a lovely meal to cook together! Glad you both enjoyed this recipe, Janet.
What are your favorite sides to serve with this chicken?
Hi Jeanie ‚Äì I love to make a side of mashed potatoes or roasted potatoes, along with a simple arugula salad tossed in my lemon vinaigrette with shaved parmesan. But you can also serve this with any other of your favorites roasted vegetables such as asparagus or broccoli.
delicious ‚Äì love the capers in this recipe.
I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre loving this chicken piccata, Riva!
Love the recipe. I just needed more lemon, personally. Easy fix. Enjoy!
This recipe was very good and easy to prepare. The combination of wine, fresh lemon, and capers worked so well together. I will be making this again, for sure.
I‚Äôm so glad you loved this chicken piccata recipe, Joyce!

Absolutely delicious! An amazing and easy dinner recipe that is company worthy!
So glad you enjoyed it, Leslie! And I agree, with how simple it is to make, it‚Äôs perfect for when company is visiting.
I made this for Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner. It was great! It really is quick and easy. I used the thin cut chicken filets (bought this way) but I will do it the way Lisa did in her video. I would have liked it browner but was afraid to overcook them due to being so thin. It‚Äôs our new favorite!
What a perfect meal for Valentine‚Äôs Day, Karen! Happy to hear it was easy to make. Hopefully they will turn out more browned next time!
Hi Lisa:
You have a really true fan in Spain. I love your recipes, your videos, the website, etc.
It‚Äôs very useful to see the video and then to print the recipe and store it if necesary.
I‚Äôm celiac so your gluten free recipes are perfect for me.
I made this recipe today and we liked it a lot. I didn‚Äôt use capers as we don‚Äôt like them. I also made riceas a dish side to pour the sauce over it. Delicious.
Thank you!
Hi Maricarmen ‚Äì I‚Äôm happy to hear you loved this chicken piccata, and enjoy my other recipes as well. On a personal note, I can‚Äôt wait to visit Spain later this year with my nephew. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs such a beautiful country. And I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get even more delicious recipe inspiration! :)
Tonight was the second time I made this and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Quick and easy for a week night meal that tastes like you were in the kitchen all day preparing it!

Thanks, Tina! I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre loving all the videos, and now this chicken piccata recipe.
I made it tonight. Delicious!
Thanks Lisa for another great recipe!
You‚Äôre more than welcome, Daniela! I‚Äôm happy you loved it!
This was delicious despite the fact I was out of wine and (didn‚Äôt know it until I‚Äôd started dinner) subbed Marsala. I also left the tablespoon of butter out of the chicken and used whipped butter in the sauce. I served it with half zoodles half chickpea thin spaghetti.
Your results sound amazing! I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed this chicken piccata dish, Heidi.
Delicious! Would not change a thing. Will be one of my faves.
Happy to hear you‚Äôre loving this chicken piccata, Lisa!
Oh my goodness! I was so surprised at how yummy this was. It‚Äôs so simple yet was flavorful. I really enjoy it with cauliflower mash with a little bit of the chicken sauce, yum üòã
Hi Maysara ‚Äì Happy to hear you loved this chicken piccata recipe! Sounds great with a side of cauliflower mash.
Changes: I omitted the wine and lemon. As we don‚Äôt like much lemon, I subbed a tiny bit of vinegar for the lemon but probably could have just skipped. I used boneless chicken thighs as that‚Äôs what I had. I pounded them a bit thinner. Otherwise followed recipe and the kids ate without complaint!
I will add for those who like me ignore the unsalted butter recommendation, use UNSALTED butter for this recipe as between the capers and my salted butter it was a bit too much.
Thanks for another keeper.
Wonderful! Glad you were able to tweak this recipe to your liking.
This is my go-to recipe as I typically have the ingredients on hand. The crispy exterior of the chicken is the best! I‚Äôve also made this without lemons and capers before and it still turns out delicious!
It‚Äôs a wonderful go-to recipe to have ‚Äì glad you enjoy it!
Made this last night‚Äîyum! Thanks for another wonderful recipe!
You‚Äôre more than welcome, Christine! I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it.
Tried this recipe it was amazing ! My family loved it. It‚Äôs so easy and felt like we were eating at an Italian restaurant. Definitely on our regular dinner schedule.
Wonderful! So happy to hear your family all loved it, Darlene!
This is the best recipe with lots of bang for the buck! Everyone raves about it and it‚Äôs my go to meal for company. The capers and lemon brightens the sauce. I serve with fettuccine. It‚Äôs a quick, simple but elegant dish!
Hi Linda ‚Äì What a great meal to serve to guests! Happy to hear this recipe has always been a hit.
My son requested Chicken Piccata for his birthday dinner. So, I checked my favorite food blogger to see if you had the recipe and bingo! Thank you for providing so many delicious recipes. I‚Äôve cooked a lot of your dishes and haven‚Äôt found one we haven‚Äôt loved.
Hi Tracy ‚Äì I‚Äôm so glad this chicken piccata was a hit for your son‚Äôs birthday!
This was very easy to make and came out delicious. I doubled the recipe to feed 6 people and had 2 left over for lunch the following day. I also made extra sauce which to me is the best part. I served it with risotto and summer squash. Very happy guests.
